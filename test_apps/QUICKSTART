For all applications there exists in some directory a Makefile with the tasks 'exec', 'restart' and 'clean'. The first executes the application coupled to MANA-Multilevel, the second restarts the application from a previous checkpoint and the third empties the checkpoint folders and possibly other files. For example, HPCG generates a 'hpcg*.txt' and 'HPCG*.txt' every execution that are also deleted when cleaning.


### HPCG ###

1) 'cd' to the build directory 'My_MPI', run the configure command and 'make'. This will create the executable 
Commands:
	cd My_MPI
	../configure My_MPI
	make
Note: Make.My_MPI is located in hpcg/setup, the configuration can be modified and other Make files are available in hpcg/setup.

2)If the previous step is succesful, the 'bin' directory in 'My_MPI' now contains 'hpcg.dat' and xhpcg. 
3)The Makefile with 'exec', 'restart' and 'clean' is located in hpcg/My_MPI/bin


### LULESH ###

1)'make' in the LULESH directory. This generates the executable.
3)'cd' to 'execution'. The Makefile with 'exec', 'restart', and 'clean' is located here.
