Done: 
	- Separated ckpt into 2, and coded basic functionality for both types
	- Ability to specify type of checkpoint in mana_status/dmtcp_command in the same manual checkpoint request

TODO:
	- Add possiblity of choosing certain checkpoint intervals (or hardcode at first) for both types of checkpoints
	- Figure out a way for mana_restart to know which ckpt type was last/should use
