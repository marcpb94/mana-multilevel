Done: 
	- Separated ckpt into 2, and coded basic functionality for both types
	- Ability to specify type of checkpoint in mana_status/dmtcp_command in the same manual checkpoint request
	- Added possiblity of choosing certain checkpoint intervals for both types of checkpoints

TODO:
	- Figure out a way for mana_restart to know which ckpt type was last/should use
